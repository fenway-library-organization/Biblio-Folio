Biblio::Folio provides the basis for a full-fledged command-line client for the
FOLIO Library Services Platform (https://www.folio.org/).

It is geared toward organizations that run multiple FOLIO "sites",
i.e., multiple installations of FOLIO or a single installation with multiple
(independent) tenants.  At this point, a site is essentially just a tenant, but
no cross-tenant capabilities have been implemented.

A single reference client (named "folio") is included.

Biblio::Folio uses the FOLIO APIs to implement a wide variety of functionality:

* Search and retrieval of any type of object (instances, source records, users, etc.)
    * Fetch objects by any searchable field, e.g., retrieve a user by
      externalSystemId
    * Iterable batch-based searchers for any type of object

* Object creation and update using POST and PUT requests

* General-purpose matching with (weighted) matchpoints and other matching constraints.

* Batch loading of users.

* Harvesting of instances, holdings records, and items -- output is a sequence
  of MARC records taken from Source Record Storage, with data from instances,
  etc., added in.
